## Hi there 👋

I work on data analytics, and real‑world problem solving.
I like building systems that turn messy data into clear insights — and learning by shipping projects in public.

Right now I’m building an event‑driven NBA analytics engine from raw play‑by‑play data, but I’m always experimenting with new ideas.
