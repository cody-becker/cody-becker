## Hi 👋

I'm Cody, a freshman CS student at Oklahoma City University.

I build data analysis projects in public — mostly exploring sports stats, financial data, and anything that sparks curiosity. Learning by doing, iterating in the open, and getting better with each project.

### 🛠️ Tools I Use
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- SQL (learning)
- Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization

### 📌 Current Projects
- **Shaq 2000–01 Season Engine** — Reconstructing a full NBA season from raw play-by-play data
- **NBA Analytics** — Building visualizations and exploring basketball data
- **BankAnalysis** — Exploring patterns in financial data
- **VideogameAnalysis** — Data-driven look at gaming trends

### 🎯 What I'm Working Toward
Building a portfolio that shows:
- Real-world problem solving with data
- Clear communication of findings
- Curiosity-driven exploration
- Continuous improvement

### 📫 Get in Touch
Working on interesting data projects or have summer 2026 internship opportunities? I'd love to connect.
